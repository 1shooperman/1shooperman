## Hi there 👋

I'm **Brandon**. This repo is my GitHub profile—the place that shows up when someone visits [github.com/1shooperman](https://github.com/1shooperman).

### About

Veteran technologist with 20+ years of experience building, fixing, breaking, and then calmly? explaining complex systems. Generalist by nature, allergic to buzzwords unless they actually do something useful.

By day I run **AGL Consulting**, helping small and mid-sized businesses modernize their tech without accidentally setting fire to their people, processes, or budgets. By night (and very early morning), I'm the guy thinking deeply about systems—technical, human, organizational and why most of them fail for boring, preventable reasons.

I'm equally comfortable discussing cloud infrastructure, mobile app architecture, and why roadmaps lie. I prefer clarity over hype, fundamentals over trends, and tools that earn their complexity. If there's a way to make something simpler, I will find it... or at least complain loudly while trying.

I live in Miami 🌴, wake up earlier than is socially acceptable, work out like I'm preparing for a very specific apocalypse, and somehow still find time to build side projects, mentor others, and question my own assumptions. I manage ADHD with structure, curiosity, and a suspicious amount of walking.

Husband, father of two, occasional writer, and future grown-up who believes technology should serve humans, not the other way around. My work is guided by a simple philosophy: **be useful, be honest, and don't ship nonsense.**
